"Reading in and Analyzing Calendar Data by Interfacing Between MySQL and Python.ipynb"

This approach is to read in .ics calendar files from Python, and to interface with a MySQL database for data storage
and analysis using SQL queries, which ideal for quickly pulling desired information. The database approach 
is optional as calendar data read in can be brought into a Pandas dataframe or analyzed in another fashion. I opted for
interfacing with a MySQL database because I intend to create a relational database from other aspects of my project. 

# Challenges
There is a key (resolved in this code) issue I found in working with the iCalendar package (perhaps someone knows of a solution) 
where I would read in data and the UTC timestamp would show up, but with no offset. After much searching online, the solution I 
came accross was to use the _fix_timezone function from the package created by:
https://github.com/oblique63/Python-GoogleCalendarParser/blob/master/calendar_parser.py. I have included their python file,
calendar_parser.py, for use with my solution (They of course deserve full credit for their Python file). 

# Future Improvements
I hope to make future improvements, including a modification of the code to have one loop that can read in any number of .ics calendar files and perform the analysis. Additionally, I intend to add in capability to read in calendar data directly from the calendar's private URL rather than requiring it be downloaded. Potentially, if time permits, I may attempt to add code that could allow for parallel processing with PySpark for cases where very large numbers of calendars need to be read in.
